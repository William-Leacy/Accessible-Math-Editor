# Accessible-Math-Editor

Authoring Maths problems and their solutions is a major challenge for those with Visual Impairment and Blindness. This is a highly visual problem domain where spatial arrangement and layout are central to the semantic interpretation for mathematical content. The challenge is to provide an easy to use interface to the authoring application which works with complex assistive technologies such as screen readers. Specific challenges include the aggregation of complex technologies and standards including approaches to Accessible STEM such as MathML, MathJax, Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA), Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Authoring Standards such as Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) and output mechanisms such as Screen readers with their nuanced application and versioning issues.

There is a multilevel of maths education to be considered from primary school maths of addition subtraction multiplication and division to the advanced notations of calculus and matrix multiplications at third level. Ironically this maths which occurs at the early stages of education presents great difficulty in presenting an authoring platform suitable for these children.

There are many complex and nuanced problems to overcome including navigation, speaking content in an appropriate and usable way, inadequacies of the accessible technologies for example the current versions of MathML, browser versioning problems, stable screen reader interfaces and so on.

This project tackles this authoring and presents a solution which focus is based on standard primary maths teaching but considers the accessibility of the process in a way that is suitable for the target audience of blind and visually impaired users. With this project the student can create a math equation within the web application and can author it by navigating and exploring the math equation with a keyboard and the Nonvisual Desktop Access (NVDA) screen reader.
